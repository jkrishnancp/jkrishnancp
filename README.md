## 🛡 Security Philosophy

1. **Measure what matters**  
   Metrics drive accountability.

2. **Precision over volume**  
   A tuned detection beats thousands of alerts.

3. **Visibility first**  
   You cannot secure what you cannot see.

4. **Assume breach**  
   Build resilience, not illusions.

5. **Automate the repeatable**  
   Elevate analyst judgment.

6. **Translate risk into business impact**  
   Speak the language of the board.

7. **Security is culture**  
   Not a department.

8. **Simplicity is strength**  
   Complexity weakens resilience.
