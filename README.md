### Security Philosophy

> *"A tuned detection beats a thousand alerts. You can't secure what you can't see. Security is a culture, not a department."*

| # | Principle | |
|---|-----------|---|
| 1 | Measure what matters | Metrics drive accountability |
| 2 | Precision over volume | Tuned detection > alert noise |
| 3 | Visibility first | You can't secure what you can't see |
| 4 | Assume breach | Build resilience, not illusions |
| 5 | Automate the repeatable | Elevate analyst judgment |
| 6 | Translate risk | Speak the language of the boardroom |
| 7 | Security is culture | Not a department |
| 8 | Simplicity is strength | Complexity weakens resilience |
